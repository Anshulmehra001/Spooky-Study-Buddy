The American Revolution (1775-1783) was a colonial revolt that took place in British America. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America.

Key events leading to the revolution:
- The Stamp Act (1765) - taxed printed materials
- The Boston Tea Party (1773) - protest against tea taxes
- The Intolerable Acts (1774) - punitive laws after the Tea Party

Important battles:
- Lexington and Concord (1775) - "shot heard round the world"
- Bunker Hill (1775) - proved colonists could fight British forces
- Saratoga (1777) - convinced France to join the war
- Yorktown (1781) - final major battle, British surrender

The war ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized American independence.
