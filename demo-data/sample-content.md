## Sample Study Materials for Demonstration

### 1. Biology - Photosynthesis (Beginner Level)

**File: photosynthesis-basics.txt**

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. Plants use chlorophyll in their leaves to capture light energy from the sun. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into glucose (sugar) and oxygen.

The basic equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

This process happens in two main stages:
1. Light-dependent reactions (occur in the thylakoids)
2. Light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle (occur in the stroma)

Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth because it produces oxygen and forms the base of most food chains.

### 2. History - American Revolution (Intermediate Level)

**File: american-revolution.txt**

The American Revolution (1775-1783) was a colonial revolt that took place in British America. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America.

Key events leading to the revolution:
- The Stamp Act (1765) - taxed printed materials
- The Boston Tea Party (1773) - protest against tea taxes
- The Intolerable Acts (1774) - punitive laws after the Tea Party

Important battles:
- Lexington and Concord (1775) - "shot heard round the world"
- Bunker Hill (1775) - proved colonists could fight British forces
- Saratoga (1777) - convinced France to join the war
- Yorktown (1781) - final major battle, British surrender

The war ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized American independence.

### 3. Chemistry - Atomic Structure (Advanced Level)

**File: atomic-structure.txt**

Atomic structure describes the arrangement of subatomic particles within an atom. An atom consists of a dense nucleus surrounded by electrons in orbital shells.

The nucleus contains:
- Protons: positively charged particles (mass ≈ 1 amu)
- Neutrons: neutral particles (mass ≈ 1 amu)

Electrons orbit the nucleus in energy levels or shells:
- First shell (K): maximum 2 electrons
- Second shell (L): maximum 8 electrons  
- Third shell (M): maximum 18 electrons

Key concepts:
- Atomic number = number of protons
- Mass number = protons + neutrons
- Isotopes = same protons, different neutrons
- Ions = atoms with gained or lost electrons

Electron configuration determines chemical properties and bonding behavior. The periodic table is organized by atomic number and electron configuration patterns.

### 4. Mathematics - Quadratic Equations (Intermediate Level)

**File: quadratic-equations.txt**

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2, written in the standard form:
ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0

Methods to solve quadratic equations:

1. Factoring: Find two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b
2. Quadratic Formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a
3. Completing the Square: Rewrite as (x + p)² = q
4. Graphing: Find x-intercepts of the parabola

The discriminant (b²-4ac) tells us about solutions:
- If positive: two real solutions
- If zero: one real solution (repeated root)
- If negative: no real solutions (complex solutions)

Applications include projectile motion, area optimization, and profit maximization problems.

### 5. Literature - Shakespeare's Hamlet (Advanced Level)

**File: hamlet-analysis.txt**

Hamlet, written by William Shakespeare around 1600, is a tragedy about Prince Hamlet of Denmark seeking revenge against his uncle Claudius, who murdered Hamlet's father.

Major themes:
- Revenge and justice
- Appearance vs. reality
- Death and mortality
- Madness (real vs. feigned)
- Corruption and moral decay

Key characters:
- Hamlet: The protagonist, Prince of Denmark
- Claudius: Hamlet's uncle and stepfather, the antagonist
- Gertrude: Hamlet's mother, Queen of Denmark
- Ophelia: Hamlet's love interest
- Polonius: Ophelia's father, advisor to Claudius

Famous soliloquies:
- "To be or not to be" (Act 3, Scene 1)
- "O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!" (Act 2, Scene 2)

The play explores the complexity of human nature and the consequences of revenge, making it one of Shakespeare's most psychologically complex works.
