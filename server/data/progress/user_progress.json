        "content": "🎃 Once upon a midnight dreary, in a haunted library...\n\nProfessor Ghostly floated through the dusty halls, carrying ancient scrolls of knowledge. \"Boo-tiful learning awaits!\" they whispered to the shadows.\n\nThe subject of Direct text input had always been mysterious, but tonight it would become clear. Madame Mystique appeared with a dramatic flourish, cape billowing in the supernatural breeze.\n\n\"Knowledge is the most powerful spell!\" they declared, pointing to the glowing text that materialized in the air:\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. Plants use chlorophyll in their leaves to capture light energy from the sun. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into glucose (sugar) and oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe basic equation for photosynthesis is:\r\n6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2\r\n\r\nThis process happens in two main stages:\r\n1. Light-dependent reactions (occur in the thylakoids)\r\n2. Light-independent reactions or Calvin ...\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the knowledge began to make sense. The spooky characters had worked their magic, transforming dry facts into memorable wisdom.\n\nAnd so, dear student, the lesson was learned in the most delightfully frightful way! 👻📚",
