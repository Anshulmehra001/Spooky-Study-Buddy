  "content": "🎃 Once upon a midnight dreary, in a haunted library...\n\nProfessor Ghostly floated through the dusty halls, carrying ancient scrolls of knowledge. \"Boo-tiful learning awaits!\" they whispered to the shadows.\n\nThe subject of Direct text input had always been mysterious, but tonight it would become clear. Madame Mystique appeared with a dramatic flourish, cape billowing in the supernatural breeze.\n\n\"Knowledge is the most powerful spell!\" they declared, pointing to the glowing text that materialized in the air:\n\nThe water cycle describes how water evaporates from the surface, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into clouds, and falls back to the surface as precipitation.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the knowledge began to make sense. The spooky characters had worked their magic, transforming dry facts into memorable wisdom.\n\nAnd so, dear student, the lesson was learned in the most delightfully frightful way! 👻📚",
