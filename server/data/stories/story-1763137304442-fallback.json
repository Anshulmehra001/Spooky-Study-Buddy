  "content": "🎃 Once upon a midnight dreary, in a haunted library...\n\nBonnie Bones floated through the dusty halls, carrying ancient scrolls of knowledge. \"Learning is in my bones!\" they whispered to the shadows.\n\nThe subject of Direct text input had always been mysterious, but tonight it would become clear. Count Studula appeared with a dramatic flourish, cape billowing in the supernatural breeze.\n\n\"I vant to teach you something new!\" they declared, pointing to the glowing text that materialized in the air:\n\nMathematics is the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. Algebra uses variables like x and y to represent unknown values.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the knowledge began to make sense. The spooky characters had worked their magic, transforming dry facts into memorable wisdom.\n\nAnd so, dear student, the lesson was learned in the most delightfully frightful way! 👻📚",
