Madame Mystique appeared with a dramatic flourish, cape billowing in the supernatural breeze.\n\n\"Knowledge is the most powerful spell!\" they declared, pointing to the glowing text that materialized in the air:\n\nAlgebra is the branch of mathematics that uses variables to represent unknown quantities.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the knowledge began to make sense. The spooky characters had worked their magic, transforming dry facts into memorable wisdom.\n\nAnd so, dear student, the lesson was learned in the most delightfully frightful way! 👻📚",
